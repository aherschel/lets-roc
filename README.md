# What is this repo?

This is a series of notes and other material produced while learning the [roc programming language](https://www.roc-lang.org). It is intended primarily for personal use, but I'm publishing it in-case it can help others who bump into the same road bumps I do.

It will be generally structured in terms of chapters based around each test project I'm putting together, but that structure may change a bit as I get more into things.

# Reproducibility

Because roc doesn't have fixed versions yet, all code snippets will be built against whatever nightly build I've installed on my machine, which is built from commit [4d47767](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/4d4776784ad03f02f217a1550a9cc41ca8a30ca9) (released June-11).

Down the road I'd like to update my workflow to be more up-to-date, but until I encounter significant roadblocks to what I'm doing I'll avoid that for now, since learning the syntax and how to think in a more FP paradigm is more important than being bleeding edge.
